| Name | Description 

| xref:BaseVersionList/updateListData.adoc[`updateListData`] 
| Updates this list with the given list of versions&period;
This is done by copying each version in the given list and inserting it
into this one&period;
We need to do this so that we can set the parents of the versions are set to this
version list&period; This can&apos;t be done in the load task, because the versions the load
task creates are on the load task&apos;s thread and Qt won&apos;t allow their parents
to be set to something created on another thread&period;
To get around that problem, we invoke this method on the GUI thread, which
then copies the versions and sets their parents correctly&period;
